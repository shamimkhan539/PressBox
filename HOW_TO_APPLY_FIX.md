# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Apply the MySQL Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** "Still same issue" - Site showing SQLite instead of MySQL  
**Root Cause:** Using OLD sites created BEFORE the fix

---

## 🔍 Why You're Still Seeing the Issue

### The Problem

The fix I implemented **ONLY applies to NEW sites created AFTER the fix**.

**Old sites** (like "miro") were created with the OLD code that:

- Didn't verify MySQL before writing wp-config.php
- Fell back to SQLite during site start (too late)
- Have wrong configuration files

**The fix CANNOT repair existing sites** - it prevents the problem for new sites.

---

## ✅ Solution: Create a New Site

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. ✅ **Delete Old Sites** (Already Done)

I've deleted the "miro" site for you.

#### 2. 🔄 **Restart the PressBox Application**

**Important:** The app still has the old "miro" site in memory.

**How to restart:**

- Close PressBox completely
- Reopen PressBox
- The "miro" site should disappear from the list

OR in the terminal:

```powershell
# Kill all Electron processes
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like "*electron*" } | Stop-Process -Force

# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

#### 3. 🆕 **Create a New Site**

**In PressBox UI:**

1. Click "Create New Site"
2. Fill in details:
    - **Site Name:** `miro` (or `test-mysql`)
    - **PHP Version:** 8.2
    - **WordPress:** latest
    - **Database:** Select **MySQL** ⬅️ IMPORTANT
    - Fill in other details

3. **Watch the Console Output** in VS Code terminal

**You should see:**

```
🏗 Creating WordPress site: miro
📋 Site configuration: {...}
...
⚙️  Configuring WordPress...
   🔍 Verifying MYSQL availability...
      🔍 Checking database server status...
      ✅ mysql 8.0.30 is running
      🔌 Testing MySQL connection...
      ✅ MySQL connection successful
   ✅ MYSQL is available and ready
   📊 Configuring WordPress with MYSQL
   ✅ WordPress configured with MYSQL
✅ WordPress site created successfully!
```

#### 4. ✅ **Verify the Site**

**Check Site Card:**

- Should show: `Database: mysql` (NOT sqlite)
- Status badge should be green "Running" or blue "File-based"

**Start the Site:**

- Click "Start Site"
- Open `http://localhost:8001`
- Should see WordPress, **NOT** "Error establishing a database connection"

---

## 🔍 What If MySQL Verification Fails?

If MySQL is not available, you'll see:

```
⚙️  Configuring WordPress...
   🔍 Verifying MYSQL availability...
      🔍 Checking database server status...
      ⚠️ mysql server is not running
      ❌ No mysql server installations found
   ⚠️ MYSQL is not available or connection failed
   🔄 Automatically switching to SQLite for this site...
   ✅ Site will use SQLite database instead
   📊 Configuring WordPress with SQLite
```

**This is GOOD!** It means:

- ✅ The fix is working
- ✅ Site will use SQLite instead (and work correctly)
- ✅ Site card will show "Database: sqlite" (accurate)
- ✅ **NO database errors** when you open the site

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Showing SQLite After Creating New Site

**Possible Causes:**

#### 1. MySQL is Actually Not Available

**Check:**

```powershell
# Check if MySQL service is running
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*mysql*" }
```

**Fix:**

- Start MySQL service manually
- OR just use SQLite (the fix will automatically choose it)

#### 2. Wrong Root Password

If you entered a wrong MySQL root password during site creation, the verification will fail and fall back to SQLite.

**Fix:**

- Create new site with correct MySQL root password
- OR leave root password empty (if no password set)

#### 3. Old Code Still Running

Make sure you restarted the dev server after my fix.

**Fix:**

```powershell
# Kill all Electron
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like "*electron*" } | Stop-Process -Force

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Console Doesn't Show Verification Messages

This means the old code is still running.

**Fix:**

1. Check that `verifyMySQLAvailability` exists in the source:

    ```powershell
    Select-String -Path "src\main\services\simpleWordPressManager.ts" -Pattern "verifyMySQLAvailability"
    ```

    Should show 4 matches.

2. Rebuild the app:

    ```powershell
    npm run build
    ```

3. Restart dev server:
    ```powershell
    npm run dev
    ```

## 📊 Comparison: Old Site vs New Site

### Old "miro" Site (Before Fix)

```json
// pressbox-config.json
{
    "config": {
        "database": "sqlite" // ← Changed to SQLite during fallback
    }
}
```

```php
// wp-config.php
define('DB_DIR', '/wp-content/database/');  // ← SQLite config
define('USE_MYSQL', false);
```

**Result:** Site shows SQLite, but may have wrong config → Errors

---

### New Site (After Fix)

```json
// pressbox-config.json
{
    "config": {
        "database": "mysql" // ← Correctly set during creation
    }
}
```

```php
// wp-config.php
define('DB_NAME', 'miro_db');     // ← MySQL config
define('DB_USER', 'wp_user');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
```

**Result:** Site shows MySQL, has correct config → Works perfectly ✅

## 🎯 What the Fix Does

### The Fix Changes When Verification Happens

**Before Fix (Broken):**

```
Create Site → Write Config → Save Site
                ↓
           Start Site → Verify MySQL → Fail → Fallback
                                              ↓
                                       Update config (too late!)
                                              ↓
                                    Site has wrong wp-config.php
                                              ↓
                                        DATABASE ERROR ❌
```

**After Fix (Working):**

```
Create Site → VERIFY MySQL FIRST
                ↓
         Available?
         ↙        ↘
       YES         NO
        ↓           ↓
   Write MySQL   Write SQLite
   wp-config     wp-config
        ↓           ↓
      Save        Save
        ↓           ↓
  Site works   Site works
     ✅           ✅
```

## ✅ Action Items for You

### Immediate Actions

1. **Restart PressBox Application**
    - Close it completely
    - Reopen it
    - Verify "miro" site is gone from the list

2. **Create New Site**
    - Name: `miro` (or any name)
    - Database: Select **MySQL**
    - Fill in details
    - Click Create

3. **Watch Console Output**
    - Look for "🔍 Verifying MYSQL availability..."
    - Should show either:
        - "✅ MYSQL is available and ready" → Will use MySQL
        - "🔄 Automatically switching to SQLite" → Will use SQLite

4. **Verify Site Works**
    - Start the site
    - Open in browser
    - Should see WordPress (NO database error)

### If You Still See Issues

**Provide me with:**

1. Console output when creating the new site
2. Screenshot of the site card (showing database type)
3. Any error messages from WordPress

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Why Can't We Fix Existing Sites?

We **could** write a migration script, but it's risky:

- Need to update wp-config.php
- Need to update pressbox-config.json
- Need to setup MySQL database retroactively
- Need to migrate SQLite data to MySQL (if applicable)
- High risk of data corruption

**Easier and safer:** Just create new sites with the fix applied.

### The Fix is Preventive, Not Corrective

- ✅ **Prevents** new sites from having the issue
- ❌ **Does NOT fix** existing broken sites
- 💡 **Solution:** Create new sites

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions above
2. Create a new site
3. Let me know:
    - Did you see the verification messages?
    - What database type does the site show?
    - Does the site work without database errors?

If you still see issues with a **newly created site**, I'll investigate further. But the old "miro" site cannot be fixed - it must be recreated.

---

**Status:** ✅ Fix is deployed, waiting for new site creation to test

**Remember:** The fix only applies to NEW sites! 🆕
