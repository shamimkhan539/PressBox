# Contributing to PressBox

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PressBox! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our local WordPress development environment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pressbox.git
    cd pressbox
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. **Create a feature branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

#### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper typing for all function parameters and returns
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown`

#### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer TypeScript function components over React.FC
- Use proper prop typing with interfaces
- Follow React best practices for state management

#### CSS Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Create reusable component classes when needed
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Follow dark/light theme patterns

### Project Structure

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/              # Shared types and utilities
```

### Component Guidelines

#### Creating New Components

1. Create component file in appropriate directory
2. Use TypeScript with proper prop interfaces
3. Export component as named export
4. Include JSDoc comments for complex components
5. Follow existing component patterns

Example component structure:

```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onAction: () => void;
  isActive?: boolean;
}

/**
 * MyComponent - Brief description
 *
 * Detailed description of component functionality
 */
export function MyComponent({ title, onAction, isActive = false }: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div className="component-styles">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for components
- Test user interactions and workflows
- Mock external dependencies (Docker, file system)

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render title correctly', () => {
    render(<MyComponent title="Test Title" onAction={jest.fn()} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Title')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should handle click events', () => {
    const mockAction = jest.fn();
    render(<MyComponent title="Test" onAction={mockAction} />);

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(mockAction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

## üîß Development Workflow

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/feature-name
    ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test your changes**:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
