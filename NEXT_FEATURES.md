## 🚀 **My Top Recommendation**

**Start with Real Docker Integration (Feature #1)** because:

- It's the foundation for all other features
- Users expect actual functionality, not mocks
- It provides immediate value and credibility
- It enables all other WordPress-related features
- It's technically challenging but achievable in 1-2 weeks

Would you like me to dive deeper into implementing any of these features? I'd recommend starting with the Docker integration to make PressBox a truly functional WordPress development environment!
