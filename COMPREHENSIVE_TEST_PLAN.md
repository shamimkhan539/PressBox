## 🚀 **Current Status: READY FOR TESTING**

### **✅ Implementation Complete:**

- ✅ Backend Services: LocalServerManager, WordPressDownloader, AdminChecker, HostsFileService
- ✅ Frontend Integration: EnvironmentStatus component, Dashboard system status button
- ✅ IPC Communication: All system APIs properly exposed and working
- ✅ Build System: Clean compilation, no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Development Server: Running successfully with HMR

---

## 🧪 **Test Plan - Phase 1: System Detection**

### **Test 1.1: System Status UI**

- [ ] **Open PressBox** (should be running on localhost:3000 in Electron)
- [ ] **Navigate to Dashboard**
- [ ] **Click "System Status"** button in Advanced Management Tools section
- [ ] **Verify Modal Opens** with system capabilities display

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ Docker Detection: Shows installed/running status
✅ PHP Detection: Shows version and path if available
✅ Admin Privileges: Shows UAC/sudo status
✅ Clear Recommendations: Guides user based on available tools
```

### **Test 1.2: Admin Privilege Detection**

- [ ] **Check Console** - No "checkAdmin is not a function" errors
- [ ] **Verify Admin Notification** - Shows if elevation needed
- [ ] **Test Cross-platform** - Works on Windows/macOS/Linux

---

## 🧪 **Test Plan - Phase 2: WordPress Site Creation (Non-Docker)**

### **Test 2.1: Site Creation Workflow**

- [ ] **Click "New Site"** button on Dashboard
- [ ] **Fill Site Details:**
    - Site Name: `test-local-site`
    - Domain: `testsite.local`
    - PHP Version: `8.2` (or available version)
- [ ] **Create Site** without Docker dependency

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ WordPress Download: Downloads latest WordPress from wordpress.org
✅ Site Directory: Creates folder structure in sites directory
✅ PHP Detection: Uses system PHP or shows installation guide
✅ Local Server: Starts PHP built-in development server
✅ Hosts File: Adds testsite.local → 127.0.0.1 entry
✅ Database Setup: Creates SQLite or file-based database
```

### **Test 2.2: Site Access**

- [ ] **Open Browser**
- [ ] **Navigate to** `http://testsite.local:8080` (or assigned port)
- [ ] **Verify WordPress** setup page loads
- [ ] **Complete WordPress** installation wizard

---

## 🧪 **Test Plan - Phase 3: Multiple Sites & Management**

### **Test 3.1: Multiple Sites**

- [ ] **Create Second Site** (`site2.local`)
- [ ] **Verify Port Management** - Different ports assigned
- [ ] **Check Hosts File** - Both domains registered
- [ ] **Test Simultaneous Access** - Both sites accessible

### **Test 3.2: Site Management**

- [ ] **Start/Stop Sites** from Dashboard
- [ ] **View Site Status** indicators
- [ ] **Delete Site** and verify cleanup (hosts file, directories)

---

## 🧪 **Test Plan - Phase 4: System Fallbacks**

### **Test 4.1: No Docker Scenario**

- [ ] **Ensure Docker not running** (or not installed)
- [ ] **Create WordPress Site**
- [ ] **Verify LocalServerManager** used instead of Docker
- [ ] **Confirm Full Functionality** without containers

### **Test 4.2: No PHP Scenario**

- [ ] **Test on system without PHP**
- [ ] **Verify Error Handling** with clear instructions
- [ ] **Check Portable PHP** download option (if implemented)
